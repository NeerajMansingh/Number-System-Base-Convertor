C program for number system base convertor

//Coded by: Neeraj Mansingh
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information: 
This program converts a user given number of any given base from 2 to 36 to any other base from 2 to 36 as per the user's wish.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input: 
1. It will ask what would you like to do from utility options (select 1 for base convertor).

2. Enter the number you want to convert.

3. Enter the base of the number you gave as input (base is from 2 to 36).

4. Enter the base to which you want the number to be converted to (It should be from 2 to 36).

5. It will give the answer.

6. If input number does not belong to the input base or the input base is out of range, program will get terminated.
